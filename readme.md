<b>Before Proceeding: </b>you must register a new Mashery ID to access mapmyapi.com if you have not done so already.<br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mapmyapi.com/member/register">MapMyFitness Register</a> 

<b>Next: </b>you need to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mapmyapi.com/login/login?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mapmyapi.com%2Fapps%2F&h=db4d73136ef86aadef1bf6b9f3002114">Log In with Mashery</a> with your new user name and password.<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brday/mmf_php_sdk_tutorial/blob/master/step_1.php">step_1.php</a> is where you will request your access tokens <br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brday/mmf_php_sdk_tutorial/blob/master/step_2.php">step_2.php</a> is where you will extract your access token and access token secret. These will be used in order to extract data from the MapMyFitness API. There is a couple of examples included to show how someone could use this data. The options are endless!
